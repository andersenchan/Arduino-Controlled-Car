# Arduino-Controlled-Car

A car that uses infrared sensors to follow a pre-determined path.

The path consists of a black tape, taped onto a white floor. We use 2 infrared sensors, one attached onto the left of the car and one attached onto the right of the car, and change the direction of the car depending on what the two sensors sees. For example, if both sensors sees white, then we keep going forward. If the left sensor sees black but the right sensor sees white, then the car must turn left.
